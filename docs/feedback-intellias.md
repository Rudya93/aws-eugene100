## Feedback for Intellias

### Sessions 19 mar 2019 - 28 mar 2019

The first day includes a lot of basic information about DevOps and platforms. I explained AWS entities related to Kubernetes. Also we had descussed of microservices, infrastructure as a code, automation etc. We have learned to setup AWS account, CLI for AWS, terraform and rolled out Kubernetes via KOPS. Big amount of time spent on questions and discussions.

The second day completely focused on Kubernetes. Guys were prepared very well at home.  We learnt about: what's kubernetes inside, how applications work in Kubernetes, how to deploy the most popular products to Kubernetes. Participants tried to do the same in personal laptops in workshop mode.

The third day was about Kubernetes stability, application debug and high availability. We setup Jenkins as an example of application and then tried to do dirty things with it.

During all workshop, participants participated in discussions, generated many questions and stumbled on critical situations. Unfortunately, the presentation wasn't so perfect but in a result, we obtained more experience in debugging and a base of discussions.

I think it was a great start for IT specialists in Kubernetes platform.
